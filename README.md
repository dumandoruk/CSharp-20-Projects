# CSharp-20-Projects

This repository contains the projects I built while following the Udemy course "C# ile 20 Derste 20 Uygulamalı Proje" - (20 Practical Projects in 20 Lessons with C#) by Murat Yücedağ
My goal is not only to recreate the course projects but also to improve and extend them with real-world features.

## Project List
- **Project 1: ADO.NET Customer Management**
  - Add, list, update, delete customers
- **Project 2: Entity Framework (DbFirst) Product Management**
  - Add, list, delete products
  -  Delete product by selecting a row from DataGridView (instead of typing ID manually)
  -  Added try–catch blocks for error handling

*(The list will be updated as I progress with new projects.)*

## About
This repository demonstrates my learning journey in C#.  
Each project starts with a basic version (from the course) and then I add new improvements, optimizations, and error handling before publishing it here.
